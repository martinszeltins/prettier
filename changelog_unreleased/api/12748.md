#### [HIGHLIGHT] Support plugins with async parsers (#12748 by @fisker, #13211 by @thorn0 and @fisker)

[`parse` function](https://prettier.io/docs/en/plugins.html#parsers) in a plugin can return a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) now.

In order to support async parsers for embedded languages, we had to introduce a breaking change to the plugin API. Namely, the `embed` method of a printer has now to match a completely new signature, incompatible with previous versions. If you're a plugin author and your plugins don't define `embed`, you have nothing to worry about, otherwise see the [docs](/docs/plugins.html#optional-embed) for details.

Also, the `preprocess` method of a printer can return a promise now.

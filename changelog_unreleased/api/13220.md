#### [BREAKING] `textToDoc` trims trailing hard lines (#13220 by @fisker)

Previously, in all core languages, after embedded code printed to `Doc`, we call `prettier.doc.utils.stripTrailingHardline()` to remove the trailing hard lines.

We believe make `textToDoc` return docs without trailing hard lines makes the plugins easier to do `embed` print.

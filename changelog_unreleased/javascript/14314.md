#### [BREAKING] Remove Flow syntax support from `babel` parser (#14314 by @fisker, @thorn0)

For historical reasons, Prettier used to recognize Flow syntax in JS files when the `parser` option was set to `babel` even if the file didn't include the `@flow` pragma. This support was limited and bad for performance, so it has been removed in Prettier main. Prettier with the `babel` parser still automatically switches to the Flow syntax if it finds the `@flow` pragma or the file has the `.js.flow` extension.

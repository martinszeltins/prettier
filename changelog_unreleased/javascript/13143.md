#### [BREAKING] Change the default value for `trailingComma` to `all` (#11479 by @fisker, #13143 by @sosukesuzuki)

Since version 2.0. we've changed the default value for `trailingComma` to `es5`.

[Internet Explorer, the last browser to not allow trailing commas in function calls, has been unsupported on June 15, 2022.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/internet-explorer-11-end-of-support) Accordingly, change the default value for `trailingComma` to `all`.

If the old behavior is still preferred, please configure Prettier with `{ "trailingComma": "es5" }`.

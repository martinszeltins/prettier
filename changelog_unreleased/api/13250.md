#### [BREAKING] Removed support for custom parser api (#13250 by @fisker and @thorn0)

Before [plugins](/docs/en/plugins.html) were a thing, Prettier had a similar but more limited feature called custom parsers. Itâ€™s been removed in v3.0.0 as its functionality was a subset of what the Plugin API did. If you used it, please check [how to migrate](/docs/en/api.html#custom-parser-api).

#### Preserve multiple spaces in inline code (#13590 by @kachkaev and @thorn0)

Previously, multiple whitespace characters in inline code were collapsed into a single space. This is no longer happening to match [CommonMark spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#backtick-string).

```markdown
<!-- Input -->
`   foo   bar   baz   `

<!-- Prettier stable -->
` foo bar baz `

<!-- Prettier main -->
`   foo   bar   baz   `
```
